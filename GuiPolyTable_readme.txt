This is a mathematica notebook that creates a congruent field of polynomials that can be congruent to any field. 
It then takes these polynomials and creates an addition and multiplication congruence table modulo x^2 + 1. 
I was assigned this in an abstract algebra class and did not want to do these very mentally taxing calculations by hand.
I know that this is not the most technically impressive example of what can be done in mathematica, in relation to UI’s and more formating on my side. 
I wanted to get this out in a short amount of time, and I don’t think that implementing those sort of things are that difficult.
